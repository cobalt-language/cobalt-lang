Macros, annotations, and intrinisics must have a name.
# Erroneous code
```
@ # <<< an erroneous annotation
fn main(): i32 = @; # <<< an erroneous intrinsic
```
# Help
There cannot be a space between the `@` and the identifier, so this is also erroneous:
```
@ extern(C) fn puts(str: i8 const*): null;
#^ remove this space
```
