Macros, annotations, and intrinisics in their function-like form must have matched parentheses.
# Erroneous code
```
# this is the only way you can get this (unless you do something weird with macros)
@version(major
```
# Help
- Check parentheses after macro uses
- Parentheses can be nested, if you for some reason want them mismatched, you need to escape them with a string, then unwrap it.
    - Like this (`@unstr` isn't implemented yet):
    ```
    @debug_toks(@unstr("("))
    ```
